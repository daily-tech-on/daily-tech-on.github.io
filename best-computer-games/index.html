						<p>Bringing all of your friends together to play couch collaboration games every day can be difficult, but there are plenty of titles to keep the fun going from afar. We have reduced the herd to some of the best games of all genres: ninja brawlers in the squad, team-oriented zombie hunters who are not Left4Dead, pixelated farming simulators, the list goes on.</p>
						<p>Browser games are nothing more than the typical computer or console games. They are usually very simple and easy to get around. You can pick them up and get started right away. You don't have to install, patch, or meet the crazy system requirements to play.</p>
						<p>These games used to be much more popular and even had large communities, but they were overshadowed by the advancement of technology. It's true, browser games will never match PC games in terms of graphics or beauty, but they're still very entertaining and engaging.</p>
						<h2>7 BEST BROWSER GAMES</h2>
						<p>Are you ready to start playing? Let’s go!</p>
						<h3>1. Absolver</h3>
						<p>Absolver is a meditative martial arts experience that teaches you how to make friends by punching. You can team up with a friend or two to conquer the game's small open world and bonus dungeons, all of which encourage teamwork. And if you don't have friends to play with, you can meet other players in the open world and try to make spontaneous friendships with simple in-game gestures. Absolver is about communicating as much as fighting, and that makes it a cooperative adventure brawler like no other.</p>
						<h3>2. Abobo’s big adventure</h3>
						<p>Abobo's Big Adventure is a relapse to the Nintendo Entertainment System in its best 8-bit era. You play as Abobo, a muscle man whose son has been kidnapped. Obviously, you have to destroy the chaos and make your way through hordes of enemies to save it.</p>
						<p>You will encounter many bosses and will have to adapt your playstyle to beat the obstacles. If you like old-school fighting games, you should check this game out. Do it fast because Aboboy is waiting to be rescued (that’s the name of his son)!</p>
						<img src="./img/abobo.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
						<h3>3. Town of salem</h3>
						<p>Town of Salem is similar to the role-playing game Mafia, which is a lot of fun at parties. There are different roles, each with different skills. There are the good (city dwellers), the bad (mafia) and the neutral.</p>
						<p>The good need to find out who the Mafia members are and to prevent them from killing all townspeople. The night phase is when the mafia strikes and you should act strategically. This game is not easy to explain. Instead, it is best to understand after trying it out.</p>
						<h3>4. Monster Hunter: World</h3>
						<p>The premise of Monster Hunter: World is straightforward: Hunt monsters, acquire new armor and weaponry, then hunt even more dangerous monsters. It mixes the simple pleasures of discovering gorgeously designed biomes and creatures with the thrill of taking on big, borderline-insurmountable bosses with a team. Somehow, it manages to make its grinding-for-the-sake-of-grinding progression system far more enjoyable than you might imagine.</p>
						<h3>5. Stardew Valley</h3>
						<p>Stardew Valley's online co-op adds nothing to the classic Harvest Moon formula other than additional players, but this one addition means everything. All the fun of farming, building relationships with villagers, and engaging in good old-fashioned agricultural capitalism is doubled, tripled, and quadrupled with up to three other players. And as we all know, there is nothing that helps sow the seeds of friendship than working together.</p>
						<h3>6. Threes</h3>
						<p>Threes is something you should definitely check out if you played 2048. This actually came before. What you need to do is combine the number of tiles before filling up the board to get as many as possible.</p>
						<p>There are some rules that add complexity, e.g. B. Combine 1s only with 2s, 3s or higher can only be combined with the same tiles, and so on. As always, you will understand better when you start playing.</p>
						<h3>7. Missile Game</h3>
						<p>Rocket game is a very simple game that can hang players on their seats. This game uses a minimalist black and white theme. However, the entertainment provided by this game is not minimal. The rocket game is fascinating and challenging. In this game, the player plays the role of passing a rocket through a tunnel.</p>
						<h2>GAME TIME</h2>
						<p>Whether you’re a casual gamer or the no-lifer type, playing browser games once in a while can be really fun. You can play some with your friends and rub your skill in their faces or play alone to relax after a hard day’s work.</p>
